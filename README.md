# locati
Locati is a family location sharing application that puts user privacy first. It will be a mobile application allowing family members to securely share their location with each other. There are many existing location sharing apps however they are often developed by companies with poor security practices or those that actively share your location information with third parties.

The project will explore different techniques for securely sharing location data between devices. I will compare each of the methods based on their ease of use by the customer, their suitability for a large scale mobile application and their ability to secure user data.

Methods I could investigate include:
- Peer-to-peer communication to share location directly between devices without the need for a central server.
- Sharing location with a typical client server model but employing end-to-end encryption for security.
- Creating a decentralised mesh network of devices that can share location data with each other and store information without the need for a server.


The app will be developed using a cross-platform framework such as React Native or Flutter. This will allow for support of a wide range of devices and wonâ€™t be limited to a specific manufacturer. After exploring the possibilities for location sharing, I will develop the most viable one into a full mobile application.
